This is a Java application to help reduce paperwork in classrooms, which traditionally use a large log book to record all the details of each student, each day

As we know, that approach is very time inefficient, and can be improvised by automating the process.

That's where this application tries to help.
It does all the heavy lifting work of maintaining the records and performing calculations like attendance percentage, which is very tedious to do manually, if you have a very large database.

We're always open to look in to any comments and bugs you may have found in our application
